## Notes
###### If you want, you can use default Z-CMD include. It's fully compatible.
###### Creator uses ```file.inc``` for creating files with data of entrances/exits          after creating, also it uses some plugins (crashdetect, streamer, sscanf)


#### Usage
###### To use script, log as RCON admins, and use following commands:
- /createentrance
- /createexit

###### Be sure to have ```dntmv.cr``` file in ```scriptfiles/entrances```
